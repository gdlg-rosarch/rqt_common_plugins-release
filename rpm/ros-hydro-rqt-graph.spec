%description
rqt_graph provides a GUI plugin for visualizing the ROS computation graph. Its
components are made generic so that other packages where you want to achieve
graph representation can depend upon this pkg (use rqt_dep to find out the pkgs
that depend. rqt_dep itself depends on rqt_graph too).

# In case we're installing to a non-standard location, look for a setup.sh
# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
