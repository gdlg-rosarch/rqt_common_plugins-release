        This class is intended to be called by rqt plugin framework class.
        Currently (12/12/2012) the whole widget is splitted into 2 panes:
        one on left allows you to choose the node(s) you work on. Right side 
        pane lets you work with the parameters associated with the node(s) you
        select on the left.
