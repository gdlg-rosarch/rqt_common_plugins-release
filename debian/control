Description: rqt_action provides a feature to introspect all available ROS action (from actionlib) types. By utilizing rqt_msg, the output format is unified with it and rqt_srv. Note that the actions shown on this plugin is the ones that are stored on your machine, not on the ROS core your rqt instance connects to.
