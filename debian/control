Description: RQT plugin for monitoring ROS processes. As of 6/10/2013, a depended library, psutil, is embedded within the package so that rqt_top doesn't require that library installed as system dependency (this approach is taken because the library's version on Ubuntu Precise is too old to provide a intended feature). However, this approach currenly runs only on certain platform (see the wiki page for tested platforms).
